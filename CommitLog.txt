Full Project Overhaul

Changed the Procedural Mesh Component for the Runtime Mesh Component. Immediate increase of performance about 10-30 times.

Project is again contained in a Plugin. Interface has not yet been modified.

Solved memory leak issues. 
Added destructors to non-UObject inheriting objects. (UObject children are attached to the native engine garbage collection)
Changed raw to smart pointers which was causing memory leaks.

Changed from new struct to default FRuntimeRenderableMeshData to avoid copy constructors. 
Notable performance increase.

Testing 2 types of sphere generation for performance and texturing.

Could previous currently support a resolution of up to 256. 
Any higher creates an index overflow.
Index Overflow fixed
